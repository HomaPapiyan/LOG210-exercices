## CarSharing application


Three entity classes are used in a collaboration - CarSharer, Journey
and Address. Each of these classes will be implemented by a (.java)
source file. these classes are used across a number of use cases and are
grouped together into a CarSharing component as Java (.class) files.
Here we are just dealing with the source files. There are two other
classes MCSUserInterface and MCSControl. Each of these will eb
implemented by a (.java) file. The MCSControl component has a dependency
on the CarSharing component and on the MCCSUserInterface Component.

A)  Draw a component diagram showing the source ocde dependencies. The
    > .class file are grouped together into two Java archive (.jar)
    > files. The MCSControl.class component will need to read a
    > configuration file (MCS.ini) and display a help file (MCS.hlp)
    > when required. The MCSControl (.class) file also has dependencies
    > on the MCSUserInterface (.java) file and the CarSharing (.jar)
    > components.
